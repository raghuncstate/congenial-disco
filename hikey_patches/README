1) Download source code for firmware as described at https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/blob/master/docs/plat/hikey.rst
2) Links to download precompiled latest images. Note that there are patch files that can be used to enable TPM support and use of UART2
   when secure96 board is connected. Uefi does not build dtbs and just uses the file as is. So for any dtb modifications we need to
   build it in the kernel tree, copy it over to OpenPlatformPkg and then rebuild uefi with the new dtb file.
	a) http://releases.linaro.org/96boards/hikey/linaro/debian/latest/ - for linux
	b) http://releases.linaro.org/96boards/hikey/linaro/binaries/latest/ - firmware images
3) Follow this link to unbrick or flash all images from scratch. mybuild.sh contains easy to use build script.
	a) https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/consumer/hikey/installation/board-recovery.md
	b) This link only flashes l-loader.bin and fip.bin. However,
           https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/consumer/hikey/installation/linux-fastboot.md uses android fastboot
           to flash the rest of the images line the boot efi image, rootfs, nvme etc. Android fastboot does not work if the host
           machine is a VM over virtualbox.
        c) To overcome the android fastboot issue, after step 3a) above, the board enters into atf-fastboot, and this can be passed
           on to the VM over virtualbox successfully. The rest of the images, nvme, kernel, rootfs, boot etc etc can all be flashed
           using atf-fastboot and there is no need to boot to android fastboot. Basically, all images can be flashed when the device
           boots into fastboot when loading recovery.bin(which is atf-fastboot bl1.bin).
4) Follow this link to build the kernel, and potentially modify device tree and use the new dtb file.
	a) https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/consumer/hikey/build/linux-kernel.md
	b) if dpkg does not work to create a package, you can build the kernel seperately and build the modules and directly transfer
           it over to /boot.
	c) Instructions to build kernel:
		1) export ARCH=arm64
		2) export CROSS_COMPILE=<path to arm64 linaro compiler>
		3) make defconfig distro.config
		4) make -j4 Image Image.gz dtbs modules LOCALVERSION=-hikey-linaro (Note: this can be split into as many steps but
                   need to make sure LOCALVERSION is appeneded alwasy, otherwise you may see issues while loading modules since
                   the version string may be different)
		5) make -j4 modules_install LOCALVERSION=-hikey-linaro INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 INSTALL_MOD_PATH=<whatever location>
